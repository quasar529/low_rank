# Efficient Method for PEFT
## LoRA

### Introduction
LoRA is a novel method for PEFT. It is based on the idea of low-rank approximation. The main idea is to approximate the original matrix by a low-rank matrix. The main advantage of LoRA is that it is very efficient. It is also very accurate for most cases.

I am studying in various ways to improve the accuracy of LoRA. I will update the code at the every end of the experiments.
